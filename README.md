# apps_script--GoogleWorkspace_UserManager
This code allows you to manage user data via google sheets and apps script.


### Current state
* Currently it works with things I need (Title, Department, Manager, Gender pronoun)
* In the HR system we use (PeopleHR)
* Feature requests and contributions with diffrent HR systems are welcomed.


### How-To's
1. You need to enable "Services", there in note on top of the code
2. Templates will add most of fomulas that just copy data but not all, pick and chose as desired.
3. TODO
