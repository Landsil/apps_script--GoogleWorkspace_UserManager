# apps_script--GoogleWorkspace_UserManager
This code allows you to manage user data via google sheets and apps script.


Currently it works with things I need (Title, Department, Manager, Genderpronoun)

In the HR system we use (PeopleHR)

Feature requests and contributions with diffrent HR systems are welcomed.
